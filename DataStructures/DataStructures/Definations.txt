DataStructres:
DataStructure is an efficient way of save and retriving Data.

Basic Datastructres:
1) Array
2) LinkedLists
3) Stack
4) Queue
5) Binary Tree
6) Binary Search Tree
7) Heap
8) Hashing


Array:
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Properties of Array:
1. Can contain multiple instance of a type
2. Numeric indexing
3. Accesing individual items
4. Static or Dynamic sizing
5. Fixed size once created

Big O notation:
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

Assumtions:
O(n+1) is O(n) => we are neglecting any constant no
O(2n) is O(n) => we are neglecting any constant multiplication

Big O notation examles:
O(1) - Example
=> Inserging an element at first in a linked list
=> adding two no

O(n) - Example
=> printing all the nos of an linked list/array ( single foreach)

O(n^2) - Example
=>  (nested two foreach)

O(log n) - Example
=> Inserting a new element in the arraged linked list
e.g: (1,2,4,7,8,9, 10) insert no 5 in the following list.

O(mn) - Example
=> nested foreach with two different limits
